# CMeson

## About

* * *

CMeson is a lightweight and developer-friendly curses interface that
provides a simplistic way to interact with the venerable Meson build
system, it is also a cross-platform application meaning it can run
on most common host systems.

The main design goals of CMeson is to provide a standalone portable
curses interface and allow the users of the Meson build system to
access all or most of Meson build systems features with minimal effort
from within the command-line.

Targeted audience we are building for is Windwos 10, MacOSX and Linux

We should make sure the test run with no failed test cases:

Installing should be easy. We install the application like so:

```console
